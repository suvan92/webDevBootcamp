        Please tell me I didn't get old. Anything but old. I was young! Oh... is he grey? Overconfidence, this, <span>and a small screwdriver</span>. Iâ€™m absolutely sorted. No. You're too short and bossy, and your nose is all funny. Usually called 'The Doctor.' Or 'The Caretaker.' Or 'Get off this planet.' Though, strictly speaking, that probably isn't a name. Goodbye, Clara. Oh, I always rip out the last page of a book. Then it doesn't have to end. I hate endings! I never know why. I only know who. I once spent a hell of a long time trying to get a gobby Australian to Heathrow airport.

        Thank you, Strax. And if I'm ever in need of advice from a psychotic potato dwarf, you'll certainly be the first to know. I know. Dinosaurs! On a spaceship!

I never know why. I only know who. It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezzes are cool. No. You're too short and bossy, and your nose is all funny. Usually called 'The Doctor.' Or 'The Caretaker.' Or 'Get off this planet.' Though, strictly speaking, that probably isn't a name.
