                I once spent a hell of a long time trying to get a gobby Australian to Heathrow airport. Oh, I always rip out the last page of a book. Then it doesn't have to end. I hate endings! Goodbye, Clara. There's something that doesn't make sense. Let's go and poke it with a stick. Brave heart, Clara. No idea. Just do what I do: hold tight and pretend it's a plan. Yes, well, it's a brilliant noise. I love that noise. Bow ties are cool. I know. Dinosaurs! On a spaceship! You are the only mystery worth solving.

                Please tell me I didn't get old. Anything but old. I was young! Oh... is he grey? Geronimo! Thank you, Strax. And if I'm ever in need of advice from a psychotic potato dwarf, you'll certainly be the first to know. I need...I need...I need... fish fingers and custard! Brave heart, Clara. Yes, well, it's a brilliant noise. I love that noise. Usually called 'The Doctor.' Or 'The Caretaker.' Or 'Get off this planet.' Though, strictly speaking, that probably isn't a name. Oh, I always rip out the last page of a book. Then it doesn't have to end. I hate endings!

                 No. You're too short and bossy, and your nose is all funny. Goodbye, Clara. Brave heart, Clara. Oh, I always rip out the last page of a book. Then it doesn't have to end. I hate endings! Come along, Pond! Frightened people. Give me a Dalek any day. I once spent a hell of a long time trying to get a gobby Australian to Heathrow airport. I never know why. I only know who. There are fixed points throughout time where things must stay exactly the way they are. This is not one of them. This is an opportunity! Whatever happens here will create its own timeline, its own reality, a temporal tipping point. The future revolves around you, here, now, so do good!
